## ✅ Contribution Policy

**Applies to: all repos**

* Contributions are welcome! Open an issue first for significant changes.
* All PRs must be linked to an open issue or clearly describe their purpose.
* Code should be consistent with the existing style (we use ESLint + Prettier).
* Write meaningful commit messages (e.g. `fix: correct permalink rendering logic`).
* New features should include appropriate tests or usage examples.
* We reserve the right to decline features that add unnecessary complexity or stray from Rift's design goals.

## ✅ Issue Policy

**For `rift`, `i18n`, `language-tools`**

* Before opening an issue, search to see if it’s already been reported or discussed.
* Bug reports should include steps to reproduce and expected vs actual behavior.
* Feature requests should explain the use case clearly.
* Use labels: `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`, `discussion`, `wontfix`, `docs`, etc.
* Issues with no activity for 30 days may be closed.

---

## ✅ Branch & Release Policy (`rift` repo)

* Main branch: `main`
* All feature work happens in topic branches (`feat/*`, `fix/*`)
* Pull requests must be reviewed by at least one core maintainer
* Releases use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
* `main` should always be buildable and deployable

---

## ✅ Security Policy (`SECURITY.md`)

**(for `rift`, optional for others)**

* Report any security vulnerabilities via email to `security@riftjs.dev`
* Do not open public issues for security problems
* We'll aim to respond within 48 hours and patch critical issues within 7 days
